# Implementing RAG Systems with LangChain and Vector Databases

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is revolutionizing how we build AI applications that can access and reason over large knowledge bases. Let's build a production-ready RAG system.

## What is RAG?

RAG combines:
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base
- **Generation**: Using LLMs to generate responses based on retrieved context
- **Augmentation**: Enhancing LLM responses with external knowledge

## Architecture Overview

\`\`\`
Document Store → Embeddings → Vector Database → Retriever → LLM → Response
\`\`\`

## Implementation

### 1. Setup and Dependencies
\`\`\`bash
pip install langchain openai chromadb sentence-transformers
\`\`\`

### 2. Document Processing
\`\`\`python
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader, PDFLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Load documents
loader = DirectoryLoader('./documents/', glob="*.pdf", loader_cls=PDFLoader)
documents = loader.load()

# Split into chunks
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=200,
    length_function=len,
)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
\`\`\`

### 3. Vector Store Setup
\`\`\`python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
)

# Create vector store
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=splits,
    embedding=embeddings,
    persist_directory="./chroma_db"
)
\`\`\`

### 4. RAG Chain Implementation
\`\`\`python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Custom prompt template
template = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question. 
If you don't know the answer, just say you don't know.

Context: {context}

Question: {question}
Answer:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=template, 
    input_variables=["context", "question"]
)

# Create RAG chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3}),
    chain_type_kwargs={"prompt": prompt}
)
\`\`\`

### 5. Advanced Features

#### Hybrid Search
\`\`\`python
from langchain.retrievers import BM25Retriever, EnsembleRetriever

# BM25 for keyword search
bm25_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_documents(splits)

# Ensemble retriever combining semantic and keyword search
ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[vectorstore.as_retriever(), bm25_retriever],
    weights=[0.7, 0.3]
)
\`\`\`

#### Metadata Filtering
\`\`\`python
# Add metadata during indexing
for doc in splits:
    doc.metadata["source_type"] = "technical_manual"
    doc.metadata["department"] = "engineering"

# Filter during retrieval
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(
    search_kwargs={
        "k": 5,
        "filter": {"department": "engineering"}
    }
)
\`\`\`

#### Conversation Memory
\`\`\`python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(
    k=5,
    memory_key="chat_history",
    return_messages=True
)

qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    OpenAI(temperature=0),
    vectorstore.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory
)
\`\`\`

## Production Considerations

### 1. Vector Database Selection

| Database | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| Chroma | Development | Simple setup | Limited scale |
| Pinecone | Production | Managed service | Cost |
| Weaviate | Enterprise | Feature rich | Complex |
| FAISS | Research | Fast | No persistence |

### 2. Embedding Models

\`\`\`python
# Compare embedding models
models = [
    "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",  # Fast, good general purpose
    "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",  # Better quality
    "text-embedding-ada-002",  # OpenAI (API call required)
]

# Benchmark retrieval quality
def evaluate_retrieval(model_name, test_queries):
    embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=model_name)
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(splits, embeddings)
    
    scores = []
    for query, expected_docs in test_queries:
        retrieved = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=5)
        score = calculate_relevance_score(retrieved, expected_docs)
        scores.append(score)
    
    return np.mean(scores)
\`\`\`

### 3. Chunk Optimization

\`\`\`python
def optimize_chunks(documents, chunk_sizes=[500, 1000, 1500]):
    results = {}
    
    for size in chunk_sizes:
        splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size=size,
            chunk_overlap=size//5  # 20% overlap
        )
        chunks = splitter.split_documents(documents)
        
        # Evaluate retrieval performance
        score = evaluate_chunking_strategy(chunks)
        results[size] = score
    
    return results
\`\`\`

### 4. API Wrapper
\`\`\`python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str
    filters: dict = None

class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
    answer: str
    sources: list
    confidence: float

@app.post("/query", response_model=QueryResponse)
async def query_rag(request: QueryRequest):
    try:
        result = qa_chain({"query": request.question})
        
        return QueryResponse(
            answer=result["result"],

## Monitoring and Evaluation

### Key Metrics
1. **Retrieval Quality**: Precision@K, Recall@K
2. **Generation Quality**: BLEU, ROUGE scores
3. **End-to-end**: Human evaluation, user feedback
4. **Performance**: Latency, throughput

### Implementation
\`\`\`python
import time
from prometheus_client import Histogram, Counter

QUERY_DURATION = Histogram('rag_query_duration_seconds', 'RAG query duration')
QUERY_COUNT = Counter('rag_queries_total', 'Total RAG queries')

@QUERY_DURATION.time()
def enhanced_query(question):
    QUERY_COUNT.inc()
    
    start_time = time.time()
    result = qa_chain({"query": question})
    end_time = time.time()
    
    # Log for analysis
    logger.info({
        "question": question,
        "answer": result["result"],
        "duration": end_time - start_time,
        "sources_count": len(result.get("source_documents", []))
    })
    
    return result
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Document Quality**: Clean, well-structured source documents
2. **Chunk Strategy**: Experiment with different chunking approaches  
3. **Retrieval Tuning**: Adjust similarity thresholds and result counts
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Iterate on system prompts for better responses
5. **Evaluation**: Continuously measure and improve system performance

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Poor Retrieval Quality
**Solutions**:
- Better chunk size/overlap tuning
- Improved embedding models
- Hybrid search approaches
- Query preprocessing

### Challenge 2: Hallucination
**Solutions**:
- Strict prompt instructions
- Confidence scoring
- Source citation requirements
- Fallback responses

### Challenge 3: Scalability
**Solutions**:
- Distributed vector databases
- Caching frequently accessed chunks
- Async processing pipelines
- Load balancing

## Conclusion

RAG systems offer a powerful way to ground LLM responses in factual information. Success depends on careful attention to document processing, retrieval quality, and continuous evaluation.

The key is to start simple, measure everything, and iteratively improve based on real user interactions.
