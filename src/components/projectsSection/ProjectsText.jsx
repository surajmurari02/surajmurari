        I have worked on a range of AI and ML projects, from real-time computer vision systems and embedding-based retrieval models to scalable LLM pipelines and hardware-accelerated inference deployments. These projects reflect a deep focus on performance, modular design, and real-world impact across edge and cloud environments.
