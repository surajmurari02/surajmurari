## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

### Testing
Currently no test framework is configured. Consider adding:
```bash
# Recommended additions
npm install --save-dev vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

## Key Features
1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with custom breakpoints
2. **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion for page transitions and scroll animations
3. **Contact Form**: EmailJS integration for contact functionality
4. **State Management**: Redux for menu toggle and global state
5. **Custom Color Scheme**: Brown/orange/cyan theme with custom shadows

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Sections
1. Create component folder in `src/components/`
2. Import and add to `App.jsx`
3. Add navigation link in `NavbarLinks.jsx`
4. Implement responsive design following existing patterns

### Modifying Colors/Theme
- Edit `tailwind.config.js` colors object
- Custom colors: brown, cyan, orange variants
- Custom shadows for glow effects

### Adding Projects
- Modify projects array in `src/components/projectsSection/ProjectsMain.jsx`
- Add corresponding images to `public/images/`
- Update links when projects are live

### Contact Form Configuration
- EmailJS service configuration in contact components
- Environment variables should be added for API keys

## Performance Considerations
- Images are served from `public/images/` - consider optimization
- Large bundle size due to Framer Motion - implement code splitting if needed
- No lazy loading currently implemented

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers supporting ES6+
- Responsive design works on mobile devices (350px+)

## Deployment Notes
- Built for static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- All assets in public folder will be served statically
- No server-side rendering currently implemented

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build failures**: Check for unused imports or syntax errors
- **Animation performance**: Reduce motion complexity for slower devices
- **Mobile layout**: Test on various screen sizes (use browser dev tools)
- **Contact form**: Verify EmailJS configuration and API keys

### Development Tips
- Use browser dev tools for responsive testing
- Check console for any React warnings
- Use Redux DevTools for state debugging
- Test animations on slower devices

## Contributing Guidelines
